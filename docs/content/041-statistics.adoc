=== Statistics

Adapters provide a set of statistics stored within a statistic store.  The set of available statistics is specific to each adapter and 
the set of attributes for those data items managed by the adapter. Statistics include:

* Ranges over an attribute, including time.
* Enveloping bounding box over all geometries.
* Cardinality of the number of stored items.
* Histograms over the range of values for an attribute.
* Cardinality of discrete values of an attribute.

Statistics are updated during data ingest and deletion.  Range and bounding box statistics reflect the largest range over time.  
Those statistics are not updated during deletion. Cardinality-based statistics are updated upon deletion.  

Statistics retain the same visibility constraints as the associated attributes.  Thus, there is a set of statistics for each unique constraint.
The statistics store answers each statistics inquiry for a given adapter with only those statistics matching the authorizations of the requester.
The statistics store merges authorized statistics covering the same attribute.

===== Re-Computation

Re-computation of statistics is required in three circumstances:

["arabic"]
. As indexed items are removed from the adapter store, the range and envelope statistics may lose their accuracy if the removed item
contains an attribute that represents the minimum or maximum value for the population. 
. New statistics added to the statistics store after data items are ingested.  These new statistics do not reflect the entire population.
. Software changes invalidate prior stored images of statistics.

A simple statistics tool is a command line tool to recompute all statistics for a given adapter.  The tool is soon to be replaced by a more comprehensive and efficient tool. 
The tool removes all statistics for adapter, scans the entire data set and reconstructs to statistics. The tool is be executed within a JVM using any of the assembled JAR files. 
The arguments to the tool are as follow, presented in the exact order required.  

* Zookeepers - Formatted as a comma-separated string: zookeeper1:port,zookeeper2:port
* Accumulo Instance ID - The "instance" that the Accumulo cluster. 
* Accumulo Username - The nme of the connection user associated with a user account managed by Accumulo, not a system, etc.
* Accumulo Password - This is an Accumulo controlled secret.
* Geowave Namespace - This is _not_ an Accumulo namespace; rather think of it as a prefix Geowave uses for index table creation.
* Geowave Adapter ID - The name of the adapter.  This is the local name for the feature name managed by the Feature Data Adapter.  
This name matches the layer name in GeoServer.
* Authorizations - Ideally, the requesting authorizations should encompass ALL authorizations of the system.  The authorizations may be provided in a comma-separated list.

Make sure JAVA_HOME is set prior to invoking the following command.

  java -cp /usr/local/geowave/ingest/geowave-ingest-tool.jar  mil.nga.giat.geowave.accumulo.util.StatsTool  "localhost:12342" "GeoWave" "root" "pAssWord" "test" "GpxTrack" "A,B&C"
